The Class Admin Console Application is a user-friendly project designed for class administrators. It offers a comprehensive set of features that enable administrators to efficiently manage their class activities. Whether logging in as an existing admin or registering as a new admin, the application provides a seamless experience.

Upon registration, new admins can securely log in with their unique ID and password. To ensure the security of the system, admins are required to verify their email address. An OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to the registered email, allowing admins to validate their account. Admins have three attempts to enter the OTP correctly; failure to do so will result in temporary blocking by the system.

Once successfully registered and logged in, admins gain access to a range of functionalities. They can effortlessly enter and update their personal data within the system. Additionally, admins can add new students, manage student courses, add and assign teachers, and allocate courses to specific teachers.
The Class Admin Console Application prioritizes ease of use and provides an intuitive interface for seamless navigation and efficient management of class-related tasks. By streamlining administrative processes, the application aims to enhance productivity and simplify class management responsibilities.

With its user-friendly design and comprehensive set of features, the Class Admin Console Application empowers class administrators to effectively oversee and organize class activities, contributing to a well-managed and efficient educational environment.
